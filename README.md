# off-positions
An easy algorithm to find off-positions for any wanted transition. The algorithm works both for a single velocity or a range of velocities, as it works given a velocity-integrated FITS file.
This project starts as a technical work to create a catalog of viable off-positions for mm and sub-mm observatories, using the data retrieved in the SEDIGISM survey (https://sedigism.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/index.html).
